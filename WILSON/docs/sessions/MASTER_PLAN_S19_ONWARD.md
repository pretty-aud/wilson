# WILSON — Master plan, Session 19 onward

Written 2026-08-01, at the end of S18, from Audrey's first real testing pass.

`docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` is the historical record (§4 ledger, §6 gap dispositions)
and stays canonical for anything already shipped. **This file is the forward
plan** and is superseded by each session's own close-out.

## How to read this

Every claim below is tagged. The distinction is load-bearing — S17 lost an hour
to acting on plausible theories, and the rule that came out of it
(`feedback_prove_before_acting.md`) is that a theory earns a measurement, never
a commit.

- **MEASURED** — verified against the code, the database, or Anthropic's docs.
  Cited so you can re-check it.
- **INFERRED** — strongly supported by code reading, not yet observed failing.
  Each one names the artifact that would settle it.
- **UNKNOWN** — reported by Audrey, not yet diagnosed. Do not plan a fix around
  a cause; plan a diagnosis.

## The headline: WILSON's AI has been down for 47 days

**MEASURED.** Anthropic retired `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` on **2026-06-15**
(`platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations`, "Model status"
table: *Retired*). Their wording: *"Requests to retired models will fail."*

WILSON hardcodes that ID at **17 call sites**. Every one has failed since that
date:

| Tool | Dead | Alive |
|---|---|---|
| D.O.G. | full deck, single page, regenerate page, image prompts | themes, text rewrite ×2, visual description |
| O.T.T.E.R. | course, subject content, single subject, both agent variants, validator | quiz |
| R.A.B.B.I.T. | intake for script, treatment, gdd, brief, pitch bible, lookbook | classifier, intake for deck/outline/notes/other |
| Assistant | agent chat | pet companion |

Everything in the "Alive" column is on `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, which is
**Active** (retirement not before 2026-10-15). That asymmetry is the diagnosis:
it is not a key problem, a proxy problem, or a WILSON bug. It is a date that
passed.

**Falsifiable prediction** — every "Alive" item works today; every "Dead" one
does not. D.O.G.'s theme generator working while full-deck generation fails
confirms it in about thirty seconds.

**Why nobody noticed for 47 days.** Not carelessness — there was nowhere to
look. No inventory of which model ran what, no surface that displayed it, and
the failure reached the user as a generic "try again". S19 and S20 exist to
make that specific blindness impossible rather than merely to swap a string.

### What was checked and found clean

Recorded so nobody re-investigates:

- **MEASURED** — no `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k` or `budget_tokens` anywhere
  in `src/` or `supabase/functions/`. These 400 on current models; their absence
  is why the migration is close to a find-and-replace.
- **MEASURED** — no trailing assistant prefills. Every `role: 'assistant'` is
  mid-history or UI state, not a prefill. Prefills 400 on current models.
- **MEASURED** — `operator-ai-keys` validates with
  `VALIDATION_MODEL = 'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001'`, which is active. **The
  operator console's "Set key" flow is not also broken.** Worth stating: it was
  a reasonable worry and it is wrong.

## Decisions taken (Audrey, 2026-08-01)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Model choice is **per function**, not per tool — all 28 call sites individually selectable. |
| D2 | Three-tier resolution: **user override → workspace override → platform default → built-in**. |
| D3 | Both admin surfaces: the **operator console** sets platform defaults; **Admin Terminal** lets a company admin override. |
| D4 | 🔑 **Company admins and users may only choose from models the WILSON operator has approved.** Free-text entry is operator-only. Everyone else gets a picker. |
| D5 | A new model ID is entered as free text by the operator and **validated against Anthropic before it can be saved**. |
| D6 | A dead or invalid configured model **falls back to a working one and warns**, naming the function. It never fails silently. |
| D7 | R.A.B.B.I.T. intake stays **per document type** (10 settings) — `MODEL_MATRIX` already works that way, and collapsing it would remove capability. |

**D4 is the one with teeth.** It means the catalogue of usable models is a
platform-level asset, and a company admin cannot put every generation on the
most expensive model available. Admins pick *from a list*; they do not type
model IDs.

---

## Session plan

Seven sessions. Audrey's original ask was "no more than 6" — that was before
per-function model selection was added as a feature. **S21–S25 are the five
sessions covering the original list; S19–S20 are the two for the new feature.**

Sessions are ordered by *what unblocks the most*, not by difficulty.

---

### S19 — Unblock the AI outage

**Goal: every tool generates again.** No UI, no migration, no Edge Function.
Deliberately the smallest change that ends the outage, because the control
plane (S20) is a much larger build and the tools should not wait for it.

| Block | Work |
|---|---|
| A ✅ | `src/lib/aiModels.js` — the registry: 28 functions, three-tier resolution, retired-model detection, loud fallback. **Done, 36 tests, committed with this plan.** |
| B | Rewire all 28 call sites to `resolveModel(key)`. Touches 6 files. |
| C | Surface the warning from D6 — a real banner, not a console line. |
| D | Guard test: no raw `claude-` literal anywhere in `src/` outside `aiModels.js`. Same source-level pattern as `authStateCallbacks.test.js`. |
| E | Verify one real generation per tool against staging. |

**Exit:** a deck generates, an O.T.T.E.R. course generates, a RABBIT script
intake parses. Vitest green. A `WIL-6001` row with token counts appears in Logs
for each.

**Defaults it ships with** — `REASONING` → `claude-sonnet-5` (the like-for-like
Sonnet 4 successor), `FAST` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (unchanged; it never
broke). Both become editable in S20.

> ⚠️ **The guard test in Block D is the point of the session.** Without it the
> next retirement is just as invisible as this one. With it, a hardcoded model
> ID cannot reach `main`.

---

### S20 — The model control plane

**Goal: Audrey adds a model in one place, and every company can use it.**

| Block | Work |
|---|---|
| A | Migration 0032: `platform_approved_models` (operator-curated catalogue), `platform_model_defaults`, `workspace_model_overrides`. RLS per D4 — companies **read** the catalogue, only `platform_operators` writes it. Follows the `workspace_ai_keys` precedent (S15). |
| B | Edge Function `operator-models`: add / retire / list approved models. **Validation before save (D5)** reuses the proven `validateKey` call shape — a 1-token `POST /v1/messages` on the candidate model. **404 = refuse; 429/5xx/network = inconclusive, do not treat as invalid.** That last clause is copied deliberately from `operator-ai-keys`: refusing a good model because Anthropic was briefly busy is its own bug. |
| C | Operator console: manage the catalogue (free text + validate), set the 28 platform defaults. |
| D | Admin Terminal: company admin overrides, **picker restricted to the approved catalogue**. |
| E | `SYSTEM SETTINGS`: per-user overrides, same restricted picker, showing which tier each value is inherited from. |
| F | pgTAP suite 39 for the new RLS. |

**Exit:** operator adds a model → it appears in every company's picker.
An admin's override beats the platform default; a user's beats the admin's.
A non-operator cannot write the catalogue — proven by pgTAP, not by inspection.

> Why `POST /v1/messages` and not `GET /v1/models/{id}` for validation: the POST
> shape is already proven in this codebase. The Models API's error semantics for
> an unknown ID have **not** been verified here. Reusing a proven call beats a
> plausible one.

---

### S21 — Data correctness and the reliability sweep

**Goal: the settings and rate-card surfaces stop lying.**

**A. `rate_cards.type` does not exist — MEASURED.** Queried staging:

```
id, workspace_id, name, source_file_id, is_default, created_at,
last_updated_by, last_updated_at, deleted_at, deleted_by,
created_by, updated_by, updated_at
```

`useRateCard.js` reads and writes `c.type === 'general' | 'internal'`. The whole
internal-vs-general feature keys on a column never added to the cloud schema.
**One root cause, two of Audrey's reports** (the "type column" error, and being
unable to reach the internal card). `rate_card_entries` is fine — it already has
`burden_type`, `overhead_type`, `wage`, `member_id`, `department`.
→ Migration 0033: add `type`, backfill existing rows to `'general'`, pgTAP suite.

**B. The unbounded `getSession()` class — INFERRED.** 18 call sites; only 4
files use `withTimeout`, all of them the auth screens S17 fixed. S17 fixed the
symptom on two screens and never swept the class. `ProfileSection.jsx:66` awaits
`getSession()` inside a `Promise.all` with no ceiling — if it never resolves,
`setLoading(false)` never runs and the panel spins forever, which matches
"loading profile and then never loads anything".

> **Settle it before fixing it.** Open the stuck Profile panel, devtools →
> Network. If a `workspace_members` request appears and returns 200 while the UI
> still says loading, the fault is after the await and this is confirmed.
> `aiProxy.js:65` is on the same unbounded list and sits on the path of every AI
> call — worth bounding regardless.

**C.** Avatar not persisting — likely the same effect as B; re-check after.
**D.** Restore password change in `SYSTEM SETTINGS`. S15 deleted the panel
because it drove a dead local-credential route (§6 #32); the copy now tells
users to go to the sign-in screen. Wire it to Supabase properly.

---

### S22 — Storage and connections

**Goal: the storage tab stops looking broken, and the web tells the truth.**

**MEASURED — why every backend button is dead on the web.**
`RabbitProvider.jsx:312` forces `'supabase'` when `window.electronAPI` is
absent. `SettingsPage.jsx:595` then disables each button when
`active || unavailableOnWeb`. On the web, Supabase is *active* (disabled) and
the other two are *unavailableOnWeb* (disabled). **All three disabled — by
construction, not a broken handler.**

- Rename the tab `RABBIT` → `Storage` (Audrey's ask).
- Make the picker honest: show Supabase as **connected**, not dead.
- Correct the mental model in the UI: **Supabase is already the zero-setup
  option** — it is WILSON's own backend, no login and no link required. It
  doesn't feel that way only because the UI never says so.
- Confirm cloud file upload/list works end to end on the web. `public.files`
  and the `rabbit-files` bucket exist (S14); whether the web path exercises them
  is **UNKNOWN**.
- Local Server and Google Drive stay desktop-only. Google Drive is read-only
  (Known #8) — a real feature, not a fix, and out of scope here.

---

### S23 — Files everywhere

**Goal:** files visible and attachable from the Resources page, D.O.G., and
R.A.B.B.I.T. against one project — Audrey's largest single ask.

Today: D.O.G. cloud projects have no attachment surface (Known #1), managed
files are local-server-only (Known #6), and Resources redirects you to RABBIT.

**Design decisions still open** — do not start until they are made. What is one
project's "files": everything under the project folder, or only what's attached?
Does the Resources view write, or only read?

---

### S24 — R.A.B.B.I.T. task management

All **UNKNOWN** — reported, not yet diagnosed. Budget diagnosis time, not just
fix time.

- New-task button in Tasks does nothing.
- Board view: typing a task and pressing Enter makes it vanish.
- Assignee dropdown doesn't populate. **Partial lead:**
  `ProjectTasksView.jsx:159` filters the roster to `project_members` when
  `projectIsStaffed` is true, and falls back to the whole roster when not — so
  either staffing rows are missing or the roster is empty. Query both before
  touching code.
- Scenes / levels / experiences toggles. **MEASURED:** local-only *by design* —
  the Supabase adapter throws (Known #5). Audrey calls these crucial.
  **Decision pending:** make them cloud-capable (migration + RLS + adapter +
  suite, a session of its own) or keep them local and replace the silent throw
  with honest copy.

---

### S25 — Design pass

- Welcome page: a black cursor blinks permanently, unattached to any input, and
  keeps blinking on the right while typing elsewhere. **UNKNOWN** — likely the
  shared `AuthCursor` from `AuthShell.jsx`, but that is a guess and must be
  confirmed in the DOM first.
- Login and welcome no longer match the original single-field aesthetic. Audrey:
  *"the only password entry with no username input was a lot cleaner."*
- New R.A.B.B.I.T. settings tab: project currency, rate card, task templates.

---

## Still owed, independent of all the above

- 🚨 **Rotate `smoke_admin`** — published in the public repo, permanent in git
  history. `OWED_AUDREY.md` §0, TPN-SDLC-007. **The one open CRITICAL, and it
  blocks the tag.**
- **Upload `invite.html` + `recovery.html` to dev and prod.** Staging is done and
  verified end-to-end (S18); the other two are not, so invites cannot work there.
- **v1.0.0 is prepared, not tagged, not merged.** Recommendation: hold. Tagging
  a release where every Sonnet-4 path 404s is a version number applied to a
  broken build. Revisit after S19.

---

## Standing rules for these sessions

1. **A theory earns a measurement, never a commit.**
   (`feedback_prove_before_acting.md`.) Label everything measured / inferred /
   guessed — Audrey reads these as claims and acts on them.
2. **Before believing an absence, prove the instrument can see a presence.**
   S18 spent a round on "zero network requests" that was an artifact of a full
   250-entry resource-timing buffer; a control fetch returning 200 was equally
   invisible.
3. **Run the whole pgTAP set before pushing a migration.** `tap-hosted.py` runs
   one suite; CI runs all of them against one database, and a new writer changes
   other suites' counts.
4. **Check `supabase/.temp/project-ref` before anything that writes.** The CLI
   is linked to **staging**, not dev.
5. **Stage explicit paths.** `git add -A` sweeps untracked files into a public
   commit.
