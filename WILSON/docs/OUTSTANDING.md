# Outstanding problems

Everything currently known to be **broken and not yet fixed**. Live document —
updated at the end of every session.

## The rule for this file

**Only add something if it is broken and unfixed.** Not "could be improved",
not "worth watching", not "we should probably". If it is fixed in the same
session it is not an entry, it is a commit message.

Three things follow from that:

- **An empty session adds nothing.** A session that fixes things and breaks
  nothing leaves this file untouched. That is a good outcome, not a gap to
  fill. Padding it with hedges makes the real entries harder to see, and a list
  nobody trusts is a list nobody reads.
- **Delete entries when they are fixed.** Cite the commit in the session
  close-out, then remove the entry. This file is the present state, not a
  history — `git log` is the history.
- **Say how you know.** Every entry is tagged, because the difference decides
  whether the next session starts by fixing or by diagnosing:
  - **MEASURED** — observed failing. Says what was run and what came back.
  - **REPORTED** — Audrey hit it; not yet reproduced or diagnosed.
  - **INFERRED** — code reading says it must break, not yet seen failing.
    Names what would settle it.

Anything that is merely unverified, interim, or planned belongs in
`MASTER_PLAN_S19_ONWARD.md`, not here.

## 🚨 Security — blocks the v1.0.0 tag

### `smoke_admin` password is in public git history
**MEASURED.** The repo `pretty-aud/wilson` is public and the password was
committed. Rotating the account does not remove it from history.
→ `OWED_AUDREY.md` §0, TPN-SDLC-007. **Audrey's action.**

### `wilson-staging` legacy `service_role` key was exposed
**MEASURED.** S19 (2026-08-02): `supabase projects api-keys` returns every key
in a single JSON line, and a `grep -v service_role` filter that assumed
line-per-key printed all of them into a session transcript. The key bypasses
RLS.
→ Rotate: dashboard → wilson-staging → Settings → API → Legacy API keys → roll
`service_role`. The `anon` key beside it is publishable and needs nothing.
**Audrey's action.** Never filter that command's output; select the one field.

## 🚨 Security — not blocking the tag, but wide

### `anon` holds ALL privileges on 25 public tables
**MEASURED (S21, wilson-dev, 2026-08-02).** `anon` holds
DELETE/INSERT/REFERENCES/SELECT/TRIGGER/TRUNCATE/UPDATE on **26 of the 36**
public tables. Only ten are clean — the ones 0028, 0030 and 0031 explicitly
revoked. This is migration 0011's blanket
`GRANT` + `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`, still in force everywhere no later
migration undid it.

Found by accident: 0032 grew the standing `ok(NOT has_table_privilege('anon',…))`
assertion into `07_rate_cards.sql` and it **failed**. 0032 closed `rate_cards`,
leaving 25.

**Nothing leaks today** — every one of those tables has RLS enabled and forced,
and an anon caller carries no JWT so the policies deny. The exposure is that
RLS is the *only* barrier: one permissive policy mistake, or one table where
RLS is dropped, is immediately world-readable. `TRUNCATE` is not subject to RLS
at all (not reachable through PostgREST, which never issues it).

→ A sweep of its own. **Do not blanket-revoke** — each table needs its
legitimate `authenticated` grants preserved, which is why 0032 did one table
and stopped. The query that lists them is in the S22 prompt.

## Broken features

### R.A.B.B.I.T. task management
**REPORTED.** Not yet reproduced or diagnosed — budget diagnosis time, not
just fix time.
- New-task button in Tasks does nothing.
- Board view: typing a task and pressing Enter makes it vanish.
- Assignee dropdown does not populate. Partial lead: `ProjectTasksView.jsx:159`
  filters the roster to `project_members` when `projectIsStaffed`, and falls
  back to the whole roster when not — so either staffing rows are missing or
  the roster is empty. **Query both before touching code.**

### Scenes / levels / experiences are unavailable on cloud projects
**MEASURED.** Local-only by design — the Supabase adapter throws (Known #5).
Audrey calls these crucial, so the current behaviour is a silent throw where
there should at least be honest copy.
→ Decision pending: make them cloud-capable (migration + RLS + adapter + suite,
a session of its own) or keep local and say so in the UI.

### Storage tab: every backend button is disabled on the web
**MEASURED (S18).** `RabbitProvider.jsx:312` forces `'supabase'` when
`window.electronAPI` is absent; `SettingsPage.jsx:595` then disables each button
when `active || unavailableOnWeb`. Supabase is *active* (disabled) and the other
two are *unavailableOnWeb* (disabled). All three disabled by construction, not
a broken handler. Reads as "storage is broken" when Supabase is in fact working.
→ S22.

### One hung `getSession()` pins the whole app's auth, and `withTimeout` cannot unpin it
**MEASURED (S21, against `@supabase/auth-js` 2.101.1 as installed.)** This
replaces the old "Profile panel can spin forever" entry, which framed the
problem as N independent call sites. It is not.

Two facts, both read out of `node_modules`:

1. **The class is far larger than the explicit call sites.** supabase-js binds
   `_getAccessToken()` into `fetchWithAuth` for *every* PostgREST, Storage and
   Functions request, and that awaits `auth.getSession()` internally
   (`supabase-js/dist/index.mjs:523-528`). So every `.from(...)` carries the
   same unbounded wait. Counting `.auth.getSession()` occurrences understates
   it by an order of magnitude.
2. **`withTimeout` races, it does not abort** — by design
   (`withTimeout.js:16-19`). The abandoned call still holds `lockAcquired` in
   auth-js, and the lock is global per `storageKey`. Every later auth operation
   then queues in `pendingInLock`, which consults **no** acquire timeout
   (`GoTrueClient.js:2232-2251`). All three clients share the one lock —
   RABBIT's `sharedAuthedClient` is the same instance.

**Consequence, and why the planned "sweep the 22 sites" was not done:** bounding
a call site restores *that site's UI* and nothing else. A sweep would have gone
green and left the app just as stuck, while letting the session report the class
as closed.

What S21 did instead (`10fcd29`): fixed the two places where the defect was
actually reachable and reportable — `ProfileSection`'s loader now has
`try/catch/finally` so `loading` clears on every path (the `Promise.all`'s
*other* leg is unbounded too, so bounding only the auth call would not have
closed it), and `aiProxy`'s pre-flight is bounded with its own code and message
rather than falling through to "Sign in to use AI features."

→ The real remediation is probably an app-level circuit-breaker or forced
re-hydrate, not per-site ceilings. **Design it before writing it.**

### Avatar does not persist
**REPORTED; root cause still unproven.** S21 falsified four hypotheses by
measurement — the `avatar_url` column, the `user-avatars` bucket (public, 2 MB,
correct MIME list), the storage policies, and the `isOwnAvatarUrl` render guard
all exist and are correct, and the self-guard trigger RAISES rather than
silently reverting and does not block `avatar_url` on a self-update.

**Definitively NOT the same cause as the loader hang above** — if the load
hangs, the component early-returns "Loading profile…" and the avatar controls
are never mounted, so no upload can start.

`10fcd29` fixed two things that were making every failure mode *look like
success*: an RLS-refused UPDATE matches zero rows and raises nothing, and the
code merged the patch into local state anyway; and the `catch` never cleared
`avatarFile`, so the blob preview survived any failure until the next mount.

→ **That makes a silent failure loud; it does not prove the report is fixed.**
If it recurs, the panel will now say what went wrong — capture that message.
The one candidate not yet excluded is whether the Storage API populates
`request.jwt.claims` with `app_metadata` at all; if it does not,
`current_workspace_id()` is NULL inside the storage policy and every upload is
refused in every environment. One devtools Network capture of the
`POST /storage/v1/object/user-avatars/...` settles it.

### O.T.T.E.R. validator findings and quiz scores are not saved
**MEASURED.** Known #2. Both generate correctly and neither result is
persisted, so the work is lost on navigation.

### D4 is enforced for stored settings, not for a hand-made request
**MEASURED (S20).** Migration 0031 FKs both override tables to
`platform_approved_models`, so an admin or user cannot *persist* an unapproved
model — verified against wilson-dev, the insert fails on
`workspace_model_overrides_model_id_fkey`. What is **not** covered: `ai-proxy`
does not check the requested model against the catalogue, so an authenticated
user with devtools can POST an arbitrary model id on a one-off request and it
will be served.

This is a deliberate scope decision (Audrey, 2026-08-02), not an oversight: a
catalogue read on the path of every AI call turns a database hiccup into an AI
outage, which is the exact failure class that cost 47 days. D4's stated purpose
— stopping a company admin putting every generation on the priciest model —
holds, because that requires *storing* a choice.
→ Fix if it ever needs to be airtight: check `model` against a cached catalogue
in `ai-proxy` and 403 on a miss, failing **open** if the catalogue read itself
fails. Not scheduled.

### Welcome page has a phantom cursor
**REPORTED.** A black cursor blinks permanently, unattached to any input, and
keeps blinking on the right while typing elsewhere. Likely the shared
`AuthCursor` from `AuthShell.jsx` — **that is a guess, confirm in the DOM
first.**
→ S25.

## Session log

Kept so the file's own history is visible without `git log`.

| Session | Added | Removed |
|---|---|---|
| S19 (2026-08-02) | staging `service_role` exposure | **email templates** (confirmed on all three projects; the entry was seeded from a stale S18 note). **wilson-dev auth config** — added and closed the same session; restored by hand, CI green on `68c9758`. |
| S20 (2026-08-02) | the D4 / `ai-proxy` boundary above — recorded because it is a stated limit of what shipped, not because anything regressed | nothing (S20 touched none of the entries below the security block) |
| S20, later the same day | nothing new. The Profile-panel entry was **corrected**: the unbounded-`getSession()` class is 26 sites, not 18, and S20 itself added two of them (`modelSources.js`, both writers). Those two are now bounded with `withTimeout` and pinned by tests that fail with a hang when the bound is removed. The rest of the class is S21's sweep. | nothing |
| S21 (2026-08-02) | the **`anon` privilege spread** (25 tables remaining) — found by a test assertion failing, not by looking for it. The **auth-js global lock**, which replaces the old Profile-panel entry with a correct account of why per-site ceilings do not fix it. | **`rate_cards.type`** (0032 + `10fcd29`, applied and verified on dev, staging and prod). **Password change missing** (`10fcd29`). **Profile panel spins forever** — superseded, see above. The avatar entry is kept but rewritten: four hypotheses falsified, the success-masking fixed, root cause still open. |

S21's own lesson, and the reason the `anon` entry exists at all: **a test
assertion written to the house convention found a hole nobody was looking for.**
The migration was scoped to add one column. The suite grew the standing
`ok(NOT has_table_privilege('anon', …))` probe because that is what the
convention says to do, it failed, and 26 tables turned out to be open. Two
independent investigators had both reasoned — correctly, from the migration
text — that no REVOKE was needed, because `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` creates no
new object and so does not trip 0011's trap. That reasoning was sound and the
conclusion was still wrong, because nobody had checked the *existing* grant
state. Reasoning about what a migration does is not a substitute for querying
what is there.

Both S19 additions were the same root cause: **a shell command built by string
interpolation, where the content was not safe for the shell.** The first
printed a `service_role` key into a transcript because a `grep -v` filter
assumed line-per-key JSON; the second ran `supabase config push` because bash
evaluated backticks inside a double-quoted `node -e`. Neither was a reasoning
error — both were quoting. See the standing rule in `MASTER_PLAN.md`.

One lesson from closing the second one, worth keeping: **the push diff showed
what it attempted, not what it changed.** Of nine settings listed, only two
were actually off when checked — `Enable email provider` and TOTP. Site URL,
OTP length, signup and confirm-email were all still original. Reading the live
state first would have replaced a nine-row restore list with a two-row one.
