# Outstanding problems

Everything currently known to be **broken and not yet fixed**. Live document —
updated at the end of every session.

## The rule for this file

**Only add something if it is broken and unfixed.** Not "could be improved",
not "worth watching", not "we should probably". If it is fixed in the same
session it is not an entry, it is a commit message.

Three things follow from that:

- **An empty session adds nothing.** A session that fixes things and breaks
  nothing leaves this file untouched. That is a good outcome, not a gap to
  fill. Padding it with hedges makes the real entries harder to see, and a list
  nobody trusts is a list nobody reads.
- **Delete entries when they are fixed.** Cite the commit in the session
  close-out, then remove the entry. This file is the present state, not a
  history — `git log` is the history.
- **Say how you know.** Every entry is tagged, because the difference decides
  whether the next session starts by fixing or by diagnosing:
  - **MEASURED** — observed failing. Says what was run and what came back.
  - **REPORTED** — Audrey hit it; not yet reproduced or diagnosed.
  - **INFERRED** — code reading says it must break, not yet seen failing.
    Names what would settle it.

Anything that is merely unverified, interim, or planned belongs in
`MASTER_PLAN_S19_ONWARD.md`, not here.

## 🚨 Security — blocks the v1.0.0 tag

### `smoke_admin` password is in public git history
**MEASURED.** The repo `pretty-aud/wilson` is public and the password was
committed. Rotating the account does not remove it from history.
→ `OWED_AUDREY.md` §0, TPN-SDLC-007. **Audrey's action.**

### `wilson-staging` legacy `service_role` key was exposed
**MEASURED.** S19 (2026-08-02): `supabase projects api-keys` returns every key
in a single JSON line, and a `grep -v service_role` filter that assumed
line-per-key printed all of them into a session transcript. The key bypasses
RLS.
→ Rotate: dashboard → wilson-staging → Settings → API → Legacy API keys → roll
`service_role`. The `anon` key beside it is publishable and needs nothing.
**Audrey's action.** Never filter that command's output; select the one field.

## Broken features

### Every R.A.B.B.I.T. create button can vanish behind one `canWrite` flag
**MEASURED gate, cause STILL NOT ESTABLISHED.** Audrey reported the New Task
button first showing the label "export", then disappearing from the Tasks tab
*and* Board view.

The gate is certain. `canOnProject(..., 'project.entity.write')`
(`projectRoleMatrix.js:70-76`) drives a single `canWrite` boolean that hides
the toolbar New task, every add-row, the per-group rows, the row menu action,
both kanban add affordances **and** the New Asset button — six surfaces from
one flag. The "export" observation is confirmed as its signature, not a
rendering glitch: the JSX order is `[count, Export, [Phase, Key Date, New
task]]`, so dropping the gated three leaves Export in New task's pixel
position.

**The single most useful fact remains a user action, not a code reading:**
`setShowNewAssetPopup(true)` has exactly one caller — the `canWrite`-gated
button — so the fact that Audrey *opened* the New Asset dialog proves
`canWrite` was **true** at that moment, and both views compute it from
identical inputs.

→ **Do not write a fix from this.** One runtime observation settles it, and it
only counts **in the browser that produced the symptom**: which account that
session holds, and whether the Admin Terminal is missing at the same moment
the New task button is. Separately, the UX is wrong either way — a reviewer
should be told why they cannot add, not have the control silently disappear.

### ~~The budget system does not exist in the cloud schema~~ — FIXED (S24, `b07b6c9`)
Deleted per the rule for this file. Migrations 0036 + 0037 applied and verified
**by query** on dev, staging and prod: nine budget settings on `projects`,
`project_members.project_title`, and five money tables (`budget_lines`,
`budget_actuals`, `budget_versions`, `expenses`, `project_rate_overrides`) with
manager-only RLS. The adapter gained the fifteen budget methods it never had.

**Three residues are NOT fixed and are recorded separately below**: the four
scene/shot/level/experience budget tabs, the Client View's `project.name` /
`project.code`, and the absent client-side gate.

The lesson worth carrying: **the plan documents named the wrong columns.** Both
`MASTER_PLAN_S19_ONWARD.md` and `SESSION_24_prompt.md` said the gap was
`margin` and `contingency`. The UI reads `budget_margin_pct` and
`budget_contingency_pct`, plus seven more. Adding `projects.margin` would have
closed the documented gap, satisfied review, and left Audrey's reported bug
100% intact. The columns were derived from a grep of the views instead.

Second lesson: **the React was already finished.** The whole budget — bid,
actuals grid, versions, per-line margin with project-default inheritance, the
client topsheet — was written and had been sitting there unable to persist
anything. The session was scoped as "build the budget" and was actually "give
the finished budget a database". Reading the UI before designing the schema is
what turned a guess into a measurement.

### ~~Four budget tabs can never render in cloud~~ — FIXED (S25, `183b4c2`)
Deleted per the rule for this file. Migration 0040 adds `scenes_enabled`,
`levels_enabled` and `experiences_enabled` (with the entities, not before
them), applied and verified **by query** on dev, staging and prod. The four
tabs appear once the matching toggle is on.

### ~~Client View prints "Project" and "--"~~ — FIXED (S25, `183b4c2`)
**And the fix was NOT the one both plan documents specified**, which is the
part worth keeping. They said to add a `projects.code` column. MEASURED:
nothing in `src/` or `electron/` has ever *written* a bare `code` key on a
project — the only writer is `ProjectSummaryView.jsx:605`,
`update('project_code', v)`. `project.code` was a **wrong read**, exactly like
`project.name` (the column is `title`), not a missing column.

Adding `code` would have closed the documented gap, passed review, and left
the topsheet printing `--` forever. pgTAP `48_scenes` probe 18 now asserts
`projects.code` does **not** exist, so the next attempt to "close the gap"
fails instead of shipping. Third repetition of the S24 `margin` lesson.

### ~~The budget UI has no client-side permission gate~~ — FIXED (S24, `dfdf386`)
The Budget tab is now hidden from anyone who is not a workspace admin or a
manager on that project, via `canSeeProjectMoney()` — the client mirror of
`can_access_project_money()`. It fails CLOSED, so the tab **appears** a beat
late for a project manager rather than being shown to a reviewer and snatched
back; `Rabbit.jsx` also redirects to Summary if a hidden tab is somehow open.

**The project control panel gate is now DONE too (S25, `ccb90e7`).** Both
questions the S25 brief said had to be answered first were — and neither
answer was the expected one:

- **Which screen?** Not a judgement call at all: `ProjectSummaryView.jsx:166`
  renders a header literally reading **"Project Control Panel"**. Asking
  Audrey which screen she meant would have been the S24 mistake (four of nine
  "questions for Audrey" were answerable from the code).
- **Which rule?** **Its own** — and emphatically not the money rule. Audrey,
  2026-08-04: *"managers and reviewers should be able to see and press the
  button and open the control panel, the budget block is managers only. basic
  team members do not need access to the panel at all."*

🚨 **`project.settings.open` is the ONLY action where a reviewer outranks a
member.** `project.entity.write` is the exact inverse on those two seats, and
`canSeeProjectMoney` admits neither — so every existing gate was wrong here in
a way that would have passed review. Gated in **two** places (the button and
the render branch), because `setShowSettings(true)` has a second caller
(`:124`, straight after creating a project) and she asked for no access rather
than a missing link. The unstaffed opening is load-bearing: a new project has
no members yet, so without it creating a project would lock you out of
configuring it.

### ~~Crew and Talent invoice folders are desktop-only~~ — FIXED (S24, `dfdf386`)
Both tabs now attach invoices through `InvoiceAttachment`, which picks with a
plain `<input type="file">` (Electron's renderer is Chromium, so the desktop
bridge was never needed to choose a file) and stores through the adapter's
`uploadFile`. Works on the web, in the desktop app, on Supabase and on Local
Server. Migration 0038 keeps invoices manager-only at BOTH layers — the
`files.is_financial` row flag and the reserved `invoices` storage path — because
the obvious implementation would have let any project member download the
invoice PDF, which is the amount they had just been denied. pgTAP `05_files`
covers it (5 → 9 assertions).

**No legacy invoice attachments exist — MEASURED, not assumed (2026-08-04).**
Queried all three environments (`budget_actuals` rows carrying an
`attachment_path` that is not a `file:` reference: **0**, on dev, staging and
prod — the table was created hours earlier by 0037) and every local project
bundle on this machine (four projects including LEGEND ROAD: **0** budget
actuals of any kind). Attaching never worked on the web, so nothing was ever
stranded on one computer.

The `InvoiceAttachment` component still handles a legacy absolute path, and
`resolveFileBaseDir` still falls back to the old directory — both are correct
if such a file ever turns up, and cost nothing. But this was briefly written up
as a caveat for Audrey, which it is not: **the population is empty.** Recorded
here so nobody re-adds it as a known limitation without querying first.

### Task templates do not exist in cloud mode
**MEASURED (S23).** `listProjectTaskTemplates` / `listTaskTemplates` have zero
occurrences in `supabaseAdapter.js` — they are `localServerAdapter`-only — so
`useTaskTemplates` returns `[]` and the New Asset dialog's Task Template
dropdown is permanently empty. The template branch
(`ProjectAssetsView.jsx:1378-1419`) is dead code in cloud, which also makes its
`role_slug` bug there unreachable (the real column is `assigned_role_slug`).
`task_template_id` is dropped by the S23 adapter allowlist rather than given a
column, because a column for a feature with no cloud implementation is schema
debt.

**NOT fixed in S25 — deliberately deferred, and this is the one scoped item
that session did not deliver.** It was in the S25 brief alongside the four
entities, and it is a genuinely separate feature rather than a missing
method: on Local Server, templates are individual JSON files in their own
directory (`electron/main.cjs:2088-2131`), workspace-scoped with a
project-scoped read. Cloud parity therefore needs a fifth table, its own RLS,
its own pgTAP suite and five adapter methods — not the two-line addition the
brief's phrasing implies. Scoping it into the tail of a session that had
already added four tables would have meant a money-adjacent schema written in
a hurry. → **S26 or later; size it as its own block, not a footnote.**

**Deferred a THIRD time in S27 — by Audrey's decision, not by drift.** Asked
directly at the start of the session whether templates should land alongside
the file work or become their own session, she chose to finish the file layer
properly. Recorded because "deferred again" and "quietly not done" look
identical in a git log a month later, and this is the first of the three
deferrals that was a deliberate choice rather than a session running out of
room. → **Its own session. It is the oldest item on this list.**

### ~~R.A.B.B.I.T. item creation fails in cloud mode~~ — FIXED (S23, `2727328`)
Deleted per the rule for this file. Migrations 0034 + 0035 and the adapter
column allowlist; proven by re-running the original probe, where the exact
payload that returned `23502` now SUCCEEDS on staging. Detail is in the commit
and the session log below.

<!-- removed: the original entry's evidence now lives in 2727328's message

Inserting the exact payload the UI sends, as an authenticated admin member of
the fixture workspace, via `tests.rls_setup()` + real JWT claims:

```
23502: null value in column "asset_id" of relation "tasks"
       violates not-null constraint
```

The chain, every hop read:
- `ProjectTasksView.jsx:406` `handleAddTask` sends `{title, status, priority}`.
  The toolbar button (`:635`) passes no defaults; the Board's inline add
  (`:1582-1594`) only sets `asset_id` when `kanbanGroup === 'asset'`, and the
  default group is `'status'`.
- `RabbitProvider.jsx:1577` adds `id`/`project_id`/`status`/`priority` — still
  no `asset_id`.
- `0000_rabbit_base_schema.sql:178` — `asset_id uuid not null references
  assets(id)`. No migration ever relaxed it. Contrast `workspace_id`, which
  IS auto-stamped by `trg_tasks_populate_workspace` (`0004:161-164`) — which
  is why adding `workspace_id` by hand changes nothing (measured, case B).
- `supabaseAdapter.js:83` `unwrap` throws; `RabbitProvider.jsx:1584` awaits
  the adapter **before** `setBundle` at `:1587`, so no row is ever added to
  state and there is no optimistic row to flicker.
- `ProjectTasksView.jsx:406` has no `try/catch` and the `onClick` arrow drops
  the rejected promise. No `unhandledrejection` handler exists anywhere in
  `src/` or `electron/`. **Net effect on screen: nothing at all.**

So "the button does nothing" is literal. And in Board view what *vanishes* is
the typed text, not a rendered card — `commitAdd` clears the input
unconditionally before the write resolves. The optimistic-insert theory in the
old plan doc is **refuted**: there is no optimistic state on this path.

Cloud-mode only. The local Express route (`main.cjs:1090-1098`) writes
`req.body` into a JSON bundle with no column check, so the same click succeeds
on Local Server. **Cheap falsifying test before anyone edits code:** switch
R.A.B.B.I.T. to Local Server and click New task. Works locally + dead in cloud
confirms this; dead in both refutes it. (The web build forces `supabase`, so
the beta always takes the failing path.)

→ **Not fixed here — deliberately.** The obvious fix is wrong on its own:
`0014_soft_delete.sql:238` makes `tasks_select` require
`EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM assets a WHERE a.id = tasks.asset_id)`, so a task with
a NULL `asset_id` fails its own SELECT policy and `.single()` returns PGRST116.
Making the column nullable would **move** the failure, not remove it. Both must
change together, and whether a task may exist without an asset is a product
decision, not a schema detail. Also worth knowing: there is **no automated
coverage of task creation at any layer** — no vitest, no pgTAP. That is why a
total failure shipped unnoticed. → S24.
-->

**Partly closed by S25 (`183b4c2`), and worth stating precisely.** There is
now creation coverage for the FOUR NEW entity tables — pgTAP 48-51 exercise
the real create payloads, and `columnAllowlist.test.js` imports the actual
`COLUMN_ALLOWLIST` (rather than mirroring it, as the older adapter tests do)
so a missing entry fails a test instead of a runtime request.
`supabaseLoadProject.test.js` closes the matching read-side gap: the existing
bundle-key guard only ever covered the LOCAL adapter, which is why S24's
permanently-empty `budgetVersions` was found by reading rather than by a test.

**Still uncovered: `tasks` and `assets` creation itself** — the two payloads
that actually broke in S23 have no vitest around them and no pgTAP insert
probe. The allowlist test covers the mechanism; it does not cover those two
tables' own payloads. That is the remaining half.

### Two of the four assignee dropdowns are hard-empty in cloud mode
**MEASURED (S23).** Upgraded from the S22 entry, which reasoned from **dev**
where `project_members` is empty. On **staging** — Audrey's actual environment
— it has 3 rows, so the *staffed* branch runs, not the fallback. The S22
conclusion was measured against the wrong database.

- ~~`TimelineView.jsx:4228` (task editor) and `ProjectAssetsView.jsx:2108`
  (asset-detail task rows) are unconditionally empty in cloud~~ — **the stated
  cause is REMOVED (S24, `b07b6c9`).** Both early-returned because
  `adapter.listTeamMembers` existed only on `localServerAdapter`; the Supabase
  adapter now implements it over the existing `workspace_directory()` RPC, and
  `loadProject` now returns `teamAssignments` from `project_members` (it was
  omitting the key, and the provider's
  `setBundle({ ...EMPTY_BUNDLE, ...next })` reset it to `[]` on every load).
  ⚠️ **This is CODE-level, not observed. STILL NOT OBSERVED after S25.** The
  adapter method exists and is built; nobody has watched these two dropdowns
  populate in the running app. S25 was asked to confirm this at runtime and
  **did not** — reaching those dropdowns needs a signed-in session against
  staging with a staffed project, which no automated check in this repo
  performs. Recorded as still-unverified rather than quietly closed: the fix
  was a by-product of the budget work (the Crew/Team tab needs the same
  roster), not a targeted repair, and an unwatched fix is not a fix.
  → **One look at the Timeline task editor on the beta settles it.**
- `ProjectTasksView`'s dropdown is on the healthy `workspace_directory()` path
  and intersects correctly — but if the roster ever resolves to `[]`, the
  staffed branch filters an empty list and yields `[]` too, and
  `useRosterMembers` **drops the error** rather than passing it through, so an
  RPC failure and a genuinely empty workspace are indistinguishable at every
  call site.

→ Roster-error surfacing is still owed: `useRosterMembers` swallowing the error
means a broken RPC and an empty workspace look identical everywhere. S25.

### ~~Scenes / levels / experiences are unavailable on cloud projects~~ — FIXED (S25, `183b4c2`)
Deleted per the rule for this file. Migration 0040 creates `scenes`, `shots`,
`levels` and `experiences` with RLS enabled and forced, sixteen policies, no
`FOR ALL` arm and zero privileges held by `anon` or `PUBLIC` — applied and
verified **by query** on dev, staging and prod. `supabaseAdapter` gained the
four list methods it never had and real implementations for the eight methods
that threw. Naming moved to `entityNaming.js` so both adapters name
identically.

They use `can_write_project`, **not** `can_access_project_money`: scenes are
ordinary project content and a team member must be able to create one.
Borrowing the money gate would have locked the feature to managers and nobody
would have noticed until someone tried to add a scene. pgTAP `48_scenes`
asserts a project member CAN write and a reviewer can read but not write.

### One hung `getSession()` pins the whole app's auth, and `withTimeout` cannot unpin it
**MEASURED (S21, against `@supabase/auth-js` 2.101.1 as installed.)** This
replaces the old "Profile panel can spin forever" entry, which framed the
problem as N independent call sites. It is not.

Two facts, both read out of `node_modules`:

1. **The class is far larger than the explicit call sites.** supabase-js binds
   `_getAccessToken()` into `fetchWithAuth` for *every* PostgREST, Storage and
   Functions request, and that awaits `auth.getSession()` internally
   (`supabase-js/dist/index.mjs:523-528`). So every `.from(...)` carries the
   same unbounded wait. Counting `.auth.getSession()` occurrences understates
   it by an order of magnitude.
2. **`withTimeout` races, it does not abort** — by design
   (`withTimeout.js:16-19`). The abandoned call still holds `lockAcquired` in
   auth-js, and the lock is global per `storageKey`. Every later auth operation
   then queues in `pendingInLock`, which consults **no** acquire timeout
   (`GoTrueClient.js:2232-2251`). All three clients share the one lock —
   RABBIT's `sharedAuthedClient` is the same instance.

**Consequence, and why the planned "sweep the 22 sites" was not done:** bounding
a call site restores *that site's UI* and nothing else. A sweep would have gone
green and left the app just as stuck, while letting the session report the class
as closed.

What S21 did instead (`10fcd29`): fixed the two places where the defect was
actually reachable and reportable — `ProfileSection`'s loader now has
`try/catch/finally` so `loading` clears on every path (the `Promise.all`'s
*other* leg is unbounded too, so bounding only the auth call would not have
closed it), and `aiProxy`'s pre-flight is bounded with its own code and message
rather than falling through to "Sign in to use AI features."

→ The real remediation is probably an app-level circuit-breaker or forced
re-hydrate, not per-site ceilings. **Design it before writing it.**

### Avatar does not persist
**REPORTED; root cause still unproven.** S21 falsified four hypotheses by
measurement — the `avatar_url` column, the `user-avatars` bucket (public, 2 MB,
correct MIME list), the storage policies, and the `isOwnAvatarUrl` render guard
all exist and are correct, and the self-guard trigger RAISES rather than
silently reverting and does not block `avatar_url` on a self-update.

**Definitively NOT the same cause as the loader hang above** — if the load
hangs, the component early-returns "Loading profile…" and the avatar controls
are never mounted, so no upload can start.

`10fcd29` fixed two things that were making every failure mode *look like
success*: an RLS-refused UPDATE matches zero rows and raises nothing, and the
code merged the patch into local state anyway; and the `catch` never cleared
`avatarFile`, so the blob preview survived any failure until the next mount.

→ **That makes a silent failure loud; it does not prove the report is fixed.**
If it recurs, the panel will now say what went wrong — capture that message.
The one candidate not yet excluded is whether the Storage API populates
`request.jwt.claims` with `app_metadata` at all; if it does not,
`current_workspace_id()` is NULL inside the storage policy and every upload is
refused in every environment. One devtools Network capture of the
`POST /storage/v1/object/user-avatars/...` settles it.

### O.T.T.E.R. validator findings and quiz scores are not saved
**MEASURED.** Known #2. Both generate correctly and neither result is
persisted, so the work is lost on navigation.

### D4 is enforced for stored settings, not for a hand-made request
**MEASURED (S20).** Migration 0031 FKs both override tables to
`platform_approved_models`, so an admin or user cannot *persist* an unapproved
model — verified against wilson-dev, the insert fails on
`workspace_model_overrides_model_id_fkey`. What is **not** covered: `ai-proxy`
does not check the requested model against the catalogue, so an authenticated
user with devtools can POST an arbitrary model id on a one-off request and it
will be served.

This is a deliberate scope decision (Audrey, 2026-08-02), not an oversight: a
catalogue read on the path of every AI call turns a database hiccup into an AI
outage, which is the exact failure class that cost 47 days. D4's stated purpose
— stopping a company admin putting every generation on the priciest model —
holds, because that requires *storing* a choice.
→ Fix if it ever needs to be airtight: check `model` against a cached catalogue
in `ai-proxy` and 403 on a miss, failing **open** if the catalogue read itself
fails. Not scheduled.

### ~~Project-scoped team member rates are not in the project manifest~~ — FIXED (S27, `5384d4e`)
Deleted per the rule for this file. Migration 0042 adds the `FINANCE` path
segment, gated by `can_access_project_money` exactly as `INVOICES` is, and
`projectRates.js` writes `projects/<id>/FINANCE/RATES.json` on both writable
backends. Applied and verified **by query** on dev, staging and prod.

Audrey chose a gated file over leaving the rates app-only (2026-08-04).

The part worth keeping: **the fix was not "add a second gated trio".** Doing
it the existing way would have put the reserved segment name in EIGHT places
that all had to agree, and the base three had to exclude BOTH — permissive
policies OR together, so a base policy that forgot `FINANCE` would serve the
rates to every project member no matter how correct the gated policy was.
That is precisely how 0038 failed. 0042 reduces the whole thing to one
`public.rabbit_money_segment(text)`; the base policies negate it, the money
policies assert it, and a third segment is a one-line change.

🚨 It is **NULL-safe by construction, and that is load-bearing rather than
tidy.** `projects/<id>/PROJECT.json` has no third path segment, so the
predicate is called with NULL; a bare `upper(seg) IN (...)` returns NULL,
`NOT NULL` is NULL, and a NULL policy expression FAILS. Without the coalesce
the manifest becomes unreadable and unwritable by everyone — pgTAP 53 probes
1, 5 and 11 all fail together when it is removed, which is how that was found.

### Welcome page has a phantom cursor
**REPORTED.** A black cursor blinks permanently, unattached to any input, and
keeps blinking on the right while typing elsewhere. Likely the shared
`AuthCursor` from `AuthShell.jsx` — **that is a guess, confirm in the DOM
first.**

## Session log

Kept so the file's own history is visible without `git log`.

| Session | Added | Removed |
|---|---|---|
| S27 (2026-08-04) | **nothing.** Nothing regressed and nothing new was found broken that is not already listed. The task-templates entry was annotated — its third deferral was Audrey's explicit decision this time, which is worth distinguishing from a session running out of room. ⚠️ The new file surfaces (FileManager in cloud, the Resources drop zone, the folder/manifest panel) are **built and not yet watched working** — that belongs in `MASTER_PLAN_S19_ONWARD.md` per this file's own rule, not here, and it is recorded there. | **project-scoped rates absent from the project folder** (0042 + `5384d4e`, applied and verified **by query** on dev, staging and prod). Two defects that were never on this list were also fixed and are recorded in the commit rather than here, because a thing found and fixed in one session is a commit message: the manifest could only ever be written ONCE per project (no UPDATE policy has ever existed on the rabbit-files bucket), and the folder tree had produced ZERO rows on any environment because its only caller was `createProject`. |
| S26 (2026-08-04) | **one entry: project-scoped rates are absent from the manifest** — a stated limit of what shipped, with the two policies that force it. Nothing regressed. The `canWrite` entry was **corrected**, not narrowed: its header claimed both leading theories were refuted while its own body reopened one of them, the same self-contradiction `267c4c3` had already fixed in the S26 brief and never carried across here. Exactly one theory is refuted, on code; the other rests on testimony and is marked INFERRED. | nothing was fixed that was on this list. S26 built new capability rather than repairing existing breakage. |
| S25 (2026-08-04) | **nothing new is broken.** Two entries were NARROWED rather than added: the `canWrite` gate (both leading theories refuted — Audrey confirms the account was `audrey`, who is admin AND project manager, and `canOnProject` already fails OPEN while permissions load, so a hung session leaves buttons PRESENT), and **task templates**, which S25 was scoped to fix and deliberately did not — it needs a fifth table and a suite, not a method. The assignee-dropdown entry is re-marked **still unobserved**: S25 was asked to confirm it at runtime and could not. | **scenes/levels/experiences unavailable in cloud**, **four budget tabs that can never render**, and **Client View printing "Project" and "--"** — all three by 0040 + `183b4c2`, applied and verified **by query** on dev, staging and prod. The Client View fix is recorded above because the documented fix (`add projects.code`) would have fixed nothing. |
| S24 (2026-08-03) | **four budget tabs that can never render** (they gate on three `projects` columns that do not exist), **Client View printing "Project" and "--"** (it reads `project.name`/`project.code`; the column is `title`), **no client-side gate on the budget UI** (a UX defect now that RLS is the authority), and **desktop-only invoice folders** in the Crew/Talent tabs. All four are pre-existing and were found by reading the budget UI properly for the first time; none is new breakage. | **the budget system's absence from the cloud schema** (0036 + 0037 + `b07b6c9`, applied and verified **by query** on dev, staging and prod). The assignee-dropdown entry was **narrowed, not closed** — the two hard-empty dropdowns' stated cause is removed at code level but has not been watched working. |
| S19 (2026-08-02) | staging `service_role` exposure | **email templates** (confirmed on all three projects; the entry was seeded from a stale S18 note). **wilson-dev auth config** — added and closed the same session; restored by hand, CI green on `68c9758`. |
| S20 (2026-08-02) | the D4 / `ai-proxy` boundary above — recorded because it is a stated limit of what shipped, not because anything regressed | nothing (S20 touched none of the entries below the security block) |
| S20, later the same day | nothing new. The Profile-panel entry was **corrected**: the unbounded-`getSession()` class is 26 sites, not 18, and S20 itself added two of them (`modelSources.js`, both writers). Those two are now bounded with `withTimeout` and pinned by tests that fail with a hang when the bound is removed. The rest of the class is S21's sweep. | nothing |
| S23 (2026-08-03) — **same conversation as S22**; it completed the S22 brief, wrote the S23 brief, then executed it in the same sitting when Audrey reported she could not create anything. No gap, nothing skipped. | **every create button can vanish behind one `canWrite` flag** — the gate is MEASURED, the cause is NOT ESTABLISHED, and the leading theory was refuted by the fact that opening the New Asset dialog proves the flag was true. **Task templates absent in cloud.** Both are pre-existing, neither was introduced this session. | **R.A.B.B.I.T. item creation** (0034 + 0035 + `2727328`, applied and verified by query on all three envs; the original failing payload now SUCCEEDS on staging). The assignee-dropdown entry was **corrected, not closed** — S22 measured it against dev, where the roster is empty; staging behaves differently and two dropdowns are hard-empty for a different reason entirely. |
| S22 (2026-08-03) | the R.A.B.B.I.T. task-creation entry, **upgraded REPORTED → MEASURED** with a reproduced `23502` and a named cause, plus a separate **assignee-dropdown** entry whose documented lead turned out to point at a branch that never runs. Neither is new breakage — the old entry was one line of guesswork and is now two entries of evidence. | the **`anon` privilege spread** (0033 + `494a13d`, applied and verified **by query** on dev, staging and prod: 25 tables → 0, and 7 anon-executable SECURITY DEFINER functions → 0). **Storage tab reads as broken on the web** (`8709b1e`). |
| S21 (2026-08-02) | the **`anon` privilege spread** (25 tables remaining) — found by a test assertion failing, not by looking for it. The **auth-js global lock**, which replaces the old Profile-panel entry with a correct account of why per-site ceilings do not fix it. | **`rate_cards.type`** (0032 + `10fcd29`, applied and verified on dev, staging and prod). **Password change missing** (`10fcd29`). **Profile panel spins forever** — superseded, see above. The avatar entry is kept but rewritten: four hypotheses falsified, the success-masking fixed, root cause still open. |

S23's lesson is **measure the environment the user is actually in.** S22
measured `project_members` on wilson-dev, found zero rows, and concluded the
staffed branch never runs — sound reasoning from a real query. But Audrey uses
the beta, which is **staging-backed**, where that table has three rows and the
opposite branch runs. The measurement was correct and the conclusion was wrong
because it was taken from the wrong database. Checking `.env.local` (dev) vs
the beta host (staging) is one command and it reframes every roster symptom.

Its corollary is about evidence ranking. The single most useful fact in the
whole investigation was not found by reading permission code: it is that
`setShowNewAssetPopup(true)` has exactly one caller, the `canWrite`-gated
button — so **Audrey having opened that dialog proves the flag was true**. A
user action that requires a precondition is direct evidence about that
precondition, and it outranks any amount of reasoning about how the flag is
computed. Two agents had built confident stories that this one observation
killed.

S22's lesson, and it is about **grantees, not grants**. The 25 tables were
granted to `anon` explicitly, so `REVOKE ... FROM anon` worked. The seven
SECURITY DEFINER functions were granted to **PUBLIC** — every one carried a
bare `=X/postgres` aclitem — so the same statement against them would have been
a **silent no-op**: no error, migration reports success, hole still open, and
nothing visible afterwards without re-querying the ACL. 0011:42 already knew
this (`REVOKE ... FROM PUBLIC, anon`) and the knowledge had not travelled.
**Check who actually holds the privilege before writing the REVOKE, and make
the post-condition scan every object rather than the ones you listed.** The
scan is what would have caught it; the list is what would have missed it.

The second half of the lesson is about scope. The recorded problem was "25
tables". Asking what *else* migration 0011's blanket grant touched found two
more things nobody had written down — the anon-executable SECURITY DEFINER
functions (a live pre-auth RLS bypass, not a latent grant) and the still-armed
`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` that would have re-opened the hole on the next
`CREATE TABLE`. Fixing only the documented 25 would have been a correct fix to
a third of the problem, and would have read as complete.

S21's own lesson, and the reason the `anon` entry exists at all: **a test
assertion written to the house convention found a hole nobody was looking for.**
The migration was scoped to add one column. The suite grew the standing
`ok(NOT has_table_privilege('anon', …))` probe because that is what the
convention says to do, it failed, and 26 tables turned out to be open. Two
independent investigators had both reasoned — correctly, from the migration
text — that no REVOKE was needed, because `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` creates no
new object and so does not trip 0011's trap. That reasoning was sound and the
conclusion was still wrong, because nobody had checked the *existing* grant
state. Reasoning about what a migration does is not a substitute for querying
what is there.

Both S19 additions were the same root cause: **a shell command built by string
interpolation, where the content was not safe for the shell.** The first
printed a `service_role` key into a transcript because a `grep -v` filter
assumed line-per-key JSON; the second ran `supabase config push` because bash
evaluated backticks inside a double-quoted `node -e`. Neither was a reasoning
error — both were quoting. See the standing rule in `MASTER_PLAN.md`.

One lesson from closing the second one, worth keeping: **the push diff showed
what it attempted, not what it changed.** Of nine settings listed, only two
were actually off when checked — `Enable email provider` and TOTP. Site URL,
OTP length, signup and confirm-email were all still original. Reading the live
state first would have replaced a nine-row restore list with a two-row one.
