// =============================================================================
// typeScale.test.js — the codemod's own guard (plan §7's grep audit, as a test)
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. T0's passes tripped no existing guard, and that is
// correct — no test in this repo pinned a type size. It is also exactly the
// hole C3c named: "the case half of the pass had no guard at all, and a mutant
// proved it". A codemod that moves 2,584 sites and leaves nothing behind to
// hold them will be undone one careless `text-xs` at a time.
//
// ── TWO RULES THIS FILE FOLLOWS, BOTH LEARNED FROM AN ADVERSARIAL REVIEW ────
//
// 1. EVERY SWEEP REGEX IS A NAMED CONST, USED BY BOTH THE ASSERTION AND ITS
//    CONTROL. The first draft re-typed each regex inside its control, so the
//    two could drift — and a reviewer proved it: narrowing the border
//    assertion to `/\bborder-[9]\b/` and planting a real `border-4` left the
//    suite green, with the control still passing, because it was proving a
//    literal in this file rather than the code path the assertion runs. That
//    is F4's trap 13 one level up.
//
// 2. EVERY PATTERN ANCHORS ON THE UTILITY ROOT, NOT ON ONE SPELLING.
//    `border-2` missed 102 live `border-b-2`; `text-…3xl` missed a `text-6xl`;
//    `rounded-sm` missed `rounded-t-sm`. An assertion that passes green over a
//    hundred live instances of the thing it names is worse than no assertion,
//    because it is read as evidence.
//
// Every block still carries a CONTROL: a synthetic string with the defect in
// it, asserted to be DETECTED, so "0 violations" cannot be confused with "the
// detector is broken".
